* DONE draw velocity lines on course chart
** DONE save min/max and allow different runs to be displayed
make a best effort to save/estimate mean and median as well (e.g. using some (approximate?) on-line selection algorithm)
- we know how many runs we're doing in advance so can use some kind of on-line kth-min algorithm for median?
- other options: do some x% of the runs and then pick the next one that's closest to the observed mean/median
found the latter easier.
* TODO integrated bashin chart
* TODO skill hints/cost calculator?
* TODO show skill activations on course chart
* TODO jp localization
* miscellany
** DONE sort skills by disp_order from the db
add to skill_meta.json
** TODO respond to url hash change events to load state
i assume theres some kind of event for this
