* DONE draw velocity lines on course chart
** DONE save min/max and allow different runs to be displayed
make a best effort to save/estimate mean and median as well (e.g. using some (approximate?) on-line selection algorithm)
- we know how many runs we're doing in advance so can use some kind of on-line kth-min algorithm for median?
- other options: do some x% of the runs and then pick the next one that's closest to the observed mean/median
found the latter easier.
* TODO integrated bashin chart
* TODO skill hints/cost calculator?
* DONE show skill activations on course chart
* TODO jp localization
* TODO choose motivation
* TODO choose popularity
probably should involve un-splitting sirius unique, try to come up with a solution that also works for the bashin chart
* TODO animations
might be cool to animate e.g., the histogram bars popping up
* miscellany
** DONE sort skills by disp_order from the db
add to skill_meta.json
** DONE respond to url hash change events to load state
i assume theres some kind of event for this
** DONE make the skill activation position tables on the right scroll when they run out of room instead of causing the viewport to scroll
this is oddly difficult, especially because i don't want the captions to also scroll so can't just wrap it in a div
css table behavior is rather strange to me
** DONE race time selector
** TODO revert to mob by deleting uma name
** DONE text search for skill picker
** DONE presets for CM/LOH
i.e. course, ground type, weather, etc
* bugs
** DONE shorter skills can overlap longer skills if the shorter skill is placed first
need to check if b.start/end is within in r in addition to r within b
** DONE skill id is repeated on each alternative
** DONE tab order in expanded uma pane is wrong
** DONE expanding uma pane sets selected uma to 2
expand button click bubbling up to tab click; need stopPropagation()
** TODO potential skill desync issues
possibly having random skills on both umas that the other doesn't have can cause the activations for random skills that
they DO both have to become desynced. need to look into this.
** DONE lock up after clicking min/max/etc in certain circumstances
